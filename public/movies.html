<h1>Three best movies according to Samridhi</h1>
<h2>My top picks of all time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This movie tells us about how to live life in a different way. Chosing our passion over the burden which we all faced all our life
    , living our life to the fullest and not taking anything seriously.
</p>
<h3>Yeh jawani hai deewani</h3>
<p>This movie is not only a source of entertainment, but also given a great lesson about life and making good friends.
    My favourite character in this movie is naina.

<h3>A silent voice </h3>
<p>This movie is an anime. Which tells us a lesson on how our past mistakes can effect our future and our mental health,
    This movie gives us the message on how bulling can affect a student's life and can give a life long mental trauma.
